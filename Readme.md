## Traveling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization

### Introduction
##### Ant Colony Optimization
Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a meta-heuristic technique in the field of swarm intelligence. It is use for solving different combinatorial optimization problems.

ACO is based on the behaviors of ant colony and their  search capability for combinatorial optimization. Analysis of natural behavior of ant colonies show that the ants move along the rich pheromone distribution on their path. The algorithm imitates this behavior.

##### Traveling Salesman Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem focused on optimization.

> A better solution often means a solution that is cheaper, shorter, or faster.
